# Syllabus

This page will host the converted syllabus content from the DOCX.

> Source: `NeoForge_1.21.1_Modding_Course_Syllabus_and_Outline.docx`

## Placeholder

We will convert the document and clean up headings, tables, and callouts. Until then, this page contains a placeholder.

!!! note "Conversion plan"
    Use Pandoc to convert the DOCX to Markdown, then split out policies and grading to their own pages if needed.
